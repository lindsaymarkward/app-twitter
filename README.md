# app-twitter
Ninja Sphere app (Go) for Twitter

Use the config in Labs (ninjasphere.local) to set your username (screen name) + authentication details, which you can get from Twitter - see: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens
Then tweet or direct message from the Actions menu.

TODO
----

  - doesn't do much yet.
  - hoping to implement Sign in with Twitter instead of copying keys/tokens - see: https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/implementing
  - need to implement some channels so it can be used by Ninja for notifications... and stuff
  - add LED pane to tweet something configurable on a tap
